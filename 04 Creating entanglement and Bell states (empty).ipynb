By definition, we need to have at least bi-partite system on which we \"entangle\" the parties. As can be expected a gate acting on both subsystems at the same time is necessary. A very usual choice for many reasons is the controlled NOT gate. This gate switches the output of the target qubit if and only if the first (control) qubit is in state one.
