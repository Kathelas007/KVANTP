# KVANTP (Introduction to Programming Quantum Computers)
By the end of this course the student will gain basic skills in programming quantum computers, which shall allow him/her to understand basic algorithms and applications from the theory of quantum information. The student will also learn how to use Python programming library Qiskit from IBM and will be able to use it to program other quantum algorithms as well.
